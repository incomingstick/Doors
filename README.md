# Doors
A RPG game where you are tasked to reach the center of a dungeon but it appears you've been stuck in an infinite loop. Every room you go in to leads to another 3 doors. Behind each door is either an enemy, trap, or nothing at all (Maybe even exp for getting through safe)! 

The game started as a command line project for a visual basic class I took. I am changing the language to C/C++ and using Qt for a GUI.
