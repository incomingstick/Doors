# Doors
A RPG game where you are tasked to reach the center of a dungeon but it appears you've been stuck in an infinite loop. Every room you go in to leads to another 3 doors. Behind each door is either an enemy, trap, or nothing at all (Maybe even exp for getting through safe)! 

The game started as a UI project I did for a Visual Basic course I took, and then became a CLI game as a final project for a super easy Java course. I am cleaning up and changing around the code. My ultimate goal would be to start converting everying into a C++ game, witha GUI again (preferably like an actual game using OpenGL).

--How to help--<br>
For now, set the Git repo to follow! I decided to scrap my work and start from scratch. I had been trying to take the java CLI version and port it to C++ using Qt, however I realized when I wrote the CLI version, I didn't write it to work with a GUI. Follow my blog at incomingstick.tumblr.com for updates. Once I have the basic structure I will add different tasks that need to be done!

If you have queastions just message me!
